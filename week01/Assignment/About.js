      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am <strong>Kiruthiga Palani</strong>, a passionate <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> 
        with a strong focus on <strong>React.js</strong>. Over the past few years, I have honed 
        my skills through practical experiences, completing two internships in Madurai:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>WebGapp Designer</strong> – Web Development</li>
        <li><strong>AstroWeb Solution</strong> – SEO</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Recently, I have been selected for a <strong>3-month internship at TechMango</strong> 
        in Madurai as a Full-Stack Developer specializing in React.js, where I aim to deepen my 
        expertise and contribute to real-world projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside web development, I have a keen interest in practical <strong>cybersecurity projects</strong>, 
        exploring vulnerabilities, and implementing secure coding practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a final-year student at <strong>Kamaraj College of Engineering and Technology</strong>, 
        I am always eager to learn, experiment with new technologies, and develop solutions that 
        make a meaningful impact. I thrive on challenges, enjoy collaborating with teams, and am 
        committed to continuous growth in both development and security domains.
